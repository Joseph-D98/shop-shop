# Shop Shop

## Description
Shop Shop is a Ecommerce platform that utilizes MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, and Stripe. An existing webpage was refactored to have a global state control the data for the categories, products and shopping cart. Additionally, I added the abilitiy to check out with stripe and offline capabilities with IndexedDB.
